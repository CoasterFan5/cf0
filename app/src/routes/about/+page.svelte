		<h2>About</h2>
		<h3>What is Zero?</h3>
		<p>
			Zero is a single account for a bunch of different online services, developed by CoasterFan5.
			It allows logins with a single account that is remembered across a small subset of internet
			services, saving you time and helping eliminate having so many accounts to manage. In
			addition, Zero can help sync certain products together, allowing them to share data through
			the Zero platform. Think of it like a Microsoft account which allows you to login to Word,
			Powerpoint, Minecraft, and other products.
		</p>
		<h3>How do I use Zero?</h3>
		<p>
			The only time you will use Zero is when logging into a connceted service. Then, just enter
			your Zero email and password, and you will be logged into the original service.
		</p>
		<h3>What services use Zero?</h3>
		<p>
			Currently, Zero is in use by BuildABot, however, as the network of services grow, so will the
			use of Zero.
